It was an initiative my foss iiita to make students familiar with opensource and development.It can be seen as a mini Google Summer of Code. This event will be held on github.

As Richard Feynman said"What I cannot create, I do not understand." We hope you will understand things as you create things throught the event.

You dont have to know anything. We expect you to learn things as you progress through the event. We will have simple bugs to complex ones. When you finish the even we assure you that you will be familiar with the basics of opensource contributions .
